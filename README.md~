Statistical tracking while you time.

So here goes.  Thus begins my journey into having content online.  Who knows how far it will go.

I'd like to build a single-page app for my friend Randy.
He is a manufacturing engineer.  Time is very important to him.  How long does machine X take to make piece Y of widget X?
So he stands by the machine and times it with a stopwatch, and then has to type all those times in to get the calculations he needs.
So I want to make a page that has just simply "start", "stop", "reset" to take timing measurements and calculate statistics.

I need to show the world that I know what I'm doing.  So any chance I see to make something unique that might be of actual use to somebody, I jump at it.
