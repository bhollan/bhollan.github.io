So this is the text version of (my portfolio)[http://bhollan.github.io/].  Have a look around.

I've been programming computers since I was 12.  I studied engineering in college and worked in hardware enginee because I didn't want to sit in a cubicle farm.  As it turns out, they have the same cubicle farms for hardware guys too.  So now that the internet is a thing, and I can work from anywhere on the planet I want, the world is my cubicle farm.  Yay!

So you can have a look aroun.  Or not.

Such professional.  Very website.  Much sleek. Do hire.
