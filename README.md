So this is the code to my portfolio.  Have a look around.

I've been programming computers since I was 12.  I studied engineering in college and worked in hardware engineering just long enough to realize that I'd rather be in front of a computer (truth be told, I was sitting in front of a computer just as much as a software guy anyway).

So you can have a look around or not.

Such professional.  Very website.  Such sleek.
